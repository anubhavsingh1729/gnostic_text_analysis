🤖 NLP Alignment Pipeline:
	•	Build sentence embeddings for each corpus.
	•	For each Nag Hammadi sentence:
	•	Find its k most similar canonical counterparts.
	•	Store results in a retrievable format (e.g., SQLite, Elasticsearch, FAISS).

🎨 Visualization:
	•	Use interactive tools (e.g., Streamlit or Plotly Dash) to show:
	•	Aligned text pairs side-by-side.
	•	Semantic similarity score.
	•	Alignment category (manual or model-predicted).

🧠 Interpretation Layer:
	•	Analyze theological motifs (e.g., how “light” is used in John vs. Gospel of Truth).
	•	Explore inversions (e.g., the creator as benevolent in NT vs. flawed demiurge in Gnostic texts).
